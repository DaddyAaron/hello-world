Following the social norms...for tomorrow!

Hello snoopers,

After an interesting eavesdropping session at my local Starbucks which involved a professor mentoring a future programmer, I was advised to start an account here to take my coding to the next level!  I hope to put this to good use.

And I had a part in creating a human.
